 * TAKE NOTE(BA)
 * In the beginning this program defined a main method with argc and argv as parameters
 * ARGC (argument counter) is represents the number of things that you entered into the 
 * command line when running this program on a terminal
 * ARGV (argument vector) is an array that holds the string values of the things that 
 * were entered on the command line when running this program
 * When you run this program, line 14 will print the value of argument on your command
 * (integer) line to console and line 17 will print the value of variable argv (char) 
 * on your console
 * Example : type it to run this program
 * INPUT : ./04-argc-argv test
 * OUTPUT (below) :
 * The value of argc    is 2
 * =============================================
 * The value of argv[0] is ./04-argc-argv
 * The value of argv[1] is test
 * =============================================
